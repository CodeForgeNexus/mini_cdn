Nexus Load Balancer is a predictive, metrics-driven load balancing system that selects the optimal backend server based on real-time performance data. It continuously monitors server latency (RTT), load, health, error rate, and bandwidth, and applies predictive analytics along with an epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit strategy to make adaptive routing decisions. A live Streamlit dashboard provides full visibility into server behavior and selection patterns, making the system suitable for academic projects, performance analysis, and intelligent traffic management demonstrations.
